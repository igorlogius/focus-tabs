    <b>Overview</b>
    <p> This addon lets you setup instant focus mappings (brings tabs into focus)<br/>
        All you need is to assign a tab to a focus shortcut and as long as the<br/>
        tab has not been closed or the assigment changed, the tab will be brought<br/>
        into focus via the corresponding focus shortcut
    </p>
